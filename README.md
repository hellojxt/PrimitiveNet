## Compile
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
conda create -n PrimNet python=3.7 pip -y
pip install 
sudo apt install libboost-dev libsparsehash-dev
sh scripts/compile.sh
```

## Download data and checkpoints
Follow the comments in download.sh to download the data and checkpoints.
```
sh scripts/download.sh
```

### Evaluation on ABC
```
sh scripts/evaluate.sh
```
Predicted results on test set are visualized in **src/results/visualize**.
Original network predictions are saved in **src/results/predictions**.

After all test set predictions are generated, an evaluation for mSegIOU/mLabelIOU/APs will be executed and final results will be saved at **src/results/statistics**.

### Train ABC from scratch
```
sh scripts/train.sh
```
Logs and trained models will be saved at **src/results/checkpoint**.

### Execute on a large scene
```
sh scripts/test_scene.sh
```
The segmented large scene is stored at **src/results/visualize/final.obj**.
